    "After nuclear envelope breakdown, PCNA protein flees out into the cytoplasm, leading to dim signal intensity during mitosis. Additionally, the rounding cell are usually hard to be captured by the microscopy within focus limit. To reconstruct mitosis event from tracking results, pcnaDeep offers two algorithms: __spatial/temporal threshold-based assocation__ and __SVM-based classifier__. The first requires no training and totally depends on thresholding setting (see [Getting_started](Getting_started.ipynb)), while the second __SVM classifier__ requires a small training set and may perform better with large heterogenity of the cell."

This can be overcome by adjusting threshold of mitosis greedy search. However, when generating ground truth, there is no need to consider these cases, i.e., do not put (141, 122, 1) in the table, but (141, 122, 0) is fine.\n",
    "    - When generating negative instances, try to 'challenge' our classifier with difficult questions. For example, track 122 is very near track 140 though not a daughte of it. Challenge the classifier by putting (140, 122, 0) in your table.\n",
